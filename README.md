# Block Spleaf

Block Spleaf is a fun little "Game mode", that was made by JojocraftTv.


It's **discontinued**.

This was just made for fun, the code is not optimized, it was just for a fun day with some friends.

If you want to use the code (I don't recommend it), you can take parts of it. 
Just be nice and give some credit.

## Features

- Generation of Platforms (All Values are changeable)
- Lucky Block (Not fully done)
- Generation of Lucky Blocks (Working, but values can be buggy)
- Some more
Just look at the code, and laughed about how bad it is :)

Hope you have a great day,
